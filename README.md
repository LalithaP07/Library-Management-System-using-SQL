This Python program performs lemmatization on text input using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). It starts by importing necessary libraries and downloading essential resources like 'punkt' for tokenization, 'averaged_perceptron_tagger' for POS tagging, and 'wordnet' for lemmatization. The program initializes a WordNetLemmatizer and includes a function to convert nltk's POS tags into a format compatible with WordNet. It defines a function to lemmatize individual words based on their POS tags and another function to process entire paragraphs by tokenizing sentences, extracting words, assigning POS tags, and applying lemmatization before reconstructing the text. An example paragraph about data science is provided, and the program outputs both the original and lemmatized versions, demonstrating how words are reduced to their root forms. This approach is useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like search engines, text analysis, and chatbots, as it helps standardize words for better processing and understanding.
